## Introduction
The backend of this program was created using Python 2.7 and the PyQt4 Library for the user interface. Since Python 2.7 will soon stop being maintained, I am currently working on translating the code to Python 3 and PyQt5. General functionality is shown below. The interface is very user friendly. As long as you have the required libraries in your system, you should be able to use without any issues. 

## Install Python Libraries
You can run this python script from terminal but you will need to install the following libraries: 
  - PyQt4
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scipy 
  - OpenCV
  - NdImage
  - Imutils 

## Running the Program
From Terminal: python Gui2A.py. Sample videos and images are provided.
